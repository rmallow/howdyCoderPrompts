The code that is created could be run multiple times.
If an object or variable is used that should only be initialized once then pass it into the entry function as a parameter and provide a function that initalizes that variable.
For example if the users asks, "Read the most recent comments off of reddit of a given subreddit"
An example response would be:
"
```python
import praw

def get_recent_comments(subreddit_name, client_id, client_secret, user_agent):
    reddit = praw.Reddit(client_id=client_id, client_secret=client_secret, user_agent=user_agent)
    subreddit = reddit.subreddit(subreddit_name)

    for comment in subreddit.stream.comments():
        print(comment.body)
```
entry: get_recent_comments
"

In this example, the reddit object should only be initialized once and instead passed into the entry function as a parameter.
The expected response would then look like:
"
```python
import praw

def setup_reddit(client_id, client_secret, user_agent)
	reddit = praw.Reddit(client_id=client_id, client_secret=client_secret, user_agent=user_agent)
	return reddit

def get_recent_comments(subreddit_name, reddit):
    subreddit = reddit.subreddit(subreddit_name)

    for comment in subreddit.stream.comments():
        print(comment.body)
```
entry: get_recent_comments
setup:
	reddit : setup_reddit
"

You do not have to call the function to setup reddit as shown in the example code. This setup will be done outside of the given code and passed into the entry function.

There could be more than one setup function to parameter, to designate which setup function goes with which parameter use the setup section as shown in the example.
Use the following format:
setup:
	<PARAMETER_1_NAME> : <FUNCTION_NAME_TO_SETUP_PARAMETER_1>
	<PARAMETER_2_NAME> : <FUNCTION_NAME_TO_SETUP_PARAMETER_2>
