The function should return a value. This value will be referred to as the data. This value can be of any type but should be specified in the explanation.
If there is a case where there shouldn't be any output from the function, then the function should return None.
If the data source has value of multiple distinct types, then the function that is produced should be a dictionary of lists where the dictionary key is the header or key value and the list contains all the values.
